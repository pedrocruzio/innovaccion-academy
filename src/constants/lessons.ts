    articleContent: '### Key Takeaways\n\n> * There are a number of ways to fund your wallet on an Ethereum scaling solution like Optimism, Arbitrum, or Polygon.\n>\n> * Centralized exchanges often provide a direct Layer 2 onramp.\n>\n> * Third-party payment apps enable users to fund a wallet on Layer 2 from a bank account or a debit or credit card.\n>\n> * Protocol bridges let users send funds from Ethereum Mainnet to Layer 2.\n\nIf you’re new to crypto, all the talk about the importance of `Layer 2` (or L2) must seem a bit odd, confusing really. In contrast to [Layer 1](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/layer-1-blockchains), which often refers to [Ethereum Mainnet](https://ethereum.org/), Layer 2 is a term for a specific type of Ethereum scaling solution that enables users to inherit the security of Ethereum but enjoy low transaction fees and fast `block` inclusion times. If you’ve ever heard of [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/), or [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) (which is really a side chain, but let’s not worry about that here), those are Layer 2 scaling solutions.\n\nWhen the Ethereum network is busy, it can cost the equivalent of 80 USD in transaction fees — known as `gwei` or gas — to swap tokens, and much more to mint NFTs or provide `liquidity` to a `decentralized exchange` (DEX) on Mainnet. When network activity is low, most transactions on Ethereum Mainnet still cost a few dollars, and it takes an [FTX-level debacle](https://www.investopedia.com/ftx-exchange-5200842) or a [beyond-hyped NFT drop](https://dappradar.com/blog/yuga-labs-600m-otherside-nft-land-sale-records-highest-gas-fees-ever-on-ethereum) to really spike transaction fees.\n\nBecause transactions on Layer 2 confirm quickly and are inexpensive to execute, many of the most innovative protocols are building on L2s. Unless you’ve been in the ecosystem for a while, however, it’s not intuitive to know how to start using Layer 2s. But there is a clear place to begin your journey into Ethereum scaling solutions: funding your `wallet` on Layer 2.\n\nThere are three main ways to fund an L2 wallet: moving your crypto from a `centralized exchange` straight to a Layer 2 network, using a third-party crypto payment service to fund an L2 wallet, or sending your digital assets from Mainnet to L2 via a bridging protocol.\n\n> Please note, you’ll need to have a cryptocurrency wallet, like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or [Tally Ho](https://tallyho.org/), and an Ethereum wallet `address` to proceed. If you haven’t yet created a `non-custodial wallet`, please [take this lesson first](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/wallet-basics)!\n>\n> After you have a non-custodial Ethereum wallet address, you’ll be ready to continue on your crypto journey.\n\n## Funding From CEXs\n\nFunding your wallet directly from a centralized exchange (CEX) is perhaps the simplest way to move digital assets to an L2, particularly if you already hold cryptocurrency on the exchange. Most major CEXs offer users this option, although it isn’t always clear to the user.\n\nOn [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), for example, users can send their funds directly to Optimism or Polygon in just a few steps:\n\n1\. Go to [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/).\n\n2\. [Purchase](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/buying-selling-or-converting-crypto/how-do-i-buy-digital-currency) or hold ETH on Coinbase.\n\n3\. Select ‘Send & Receive’, located at the top of the website.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Rzdn6KxR4U-oVpcgLs_fL.png?height=209&width=1440)\n\n4\. Enter the amount in fiat or ETH you wish to send (you can toggle between fiat and crypto to the right of the amount), select ‘Pay with’ and choose Ethereum, and in the ‘To’ field, enter the wallet address where the funds will be sent. Select ‘Continue’.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F2uysvYIN69lbn9rz0yLsf.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n5\. On the next screen, select ‘Network’ and change the network from Ethereum to Optimism.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fz_DzBI1lJFVKNisD-8Rcs.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n6\. Review, and if accurate, select ‘Send Now’.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F-J0-k8BzvPCPPJLmnkQw-.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\nMost major exchanges offer users the ability to send their crypto directly to an L2. [Binance](https://www.binance.com/) supports Optimism and Arbitrum, for example. On whatever centralized exchange you convert fiat to crypto, check to see whether it offers support for direct-to-L2 services. Pro Tip: Use [Blockscan](https://blockscan.com/exchanges) to find the exchange compatible with your preferred L2.\n\n## Third-Party Onramps\n\nAnother simple way to fund your L2 wallet is to take advantage of direct-to-L2 services offered by many third-party crypto payment companies. [MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/), [Ramp](https://ramp.network/buy/), and [Transak](https://global.transak.com/) are three of the most popular options to fund crypto wallets without having to use a centralized exchange.\n\nLike most exchanges, these third-party onramps will require you to provide Know-Your-Customer information. However, once you get past those basic hurdles, these payment options are an easy way to buy crypto across the ecosystem and transfer it to Layer 2.\n\nFor MoonPay, the steps are:\n\n1\. Go to [MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/).\n\n2\. Select ‘Buy crypto’, located at the top or middle of the website.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FUU9Uswhysj9w4WBYI4VWL.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n3\. Enter the amount of fiat you wish to send and the proper denomination.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FckrX4LeU78MqcPvpAq_VM.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n4\. Select a digital asset, in this case ETH. Type in “ETH\'“ and you will see different networks on which you can purchase ETH (you may need to scroll down); choose the Layer 2 you want to use. Click ‘Continue’.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FLfhhGbE1yfWdOpG1Z5N5S.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n5\. Next, you will be prompted to enter personal verification and payment data.\n\n6\. Once complete, enter your Ethereum wallet address. You’ll be asked to make sure the wallet is safe to use.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fn5hbzW-CVKzp3392TT91I.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n7\. Complete, confirm the information is correct, and select ‘Pay’.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F7ZBiVMjLfxQ66p8-cLBhN.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\nAs with CEXs, most major third-party payment onramps provide direct-to-L2 functionality. Take advantage of these innovations to save on transaction fees and increase the range of your `blockchain` explorations.\n\n## Funding Via Bridges\n\nIf you already have funds on Ethereum Mainnet, by far the easiest way to get your crypto on to L2 is to use a bridging protocol. Bridges are the name we’ve given to protocols designed to help us move our funds around the cryptoverse, and there are a number of bridges designed to move crypto from Ethereum Mainnet to Layer 2s.\n\n### Native Bridges\n\nNative bridges are those designed by the Layer 2 protocols themselves. For true Layer 2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, it takes about 30 minutes to move funds onto L2, but one week to move that crypto back over to Mainnet. The [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) and the [Optimism Bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge/) both take longer to transfer assets and settle transactions because of the way the scaling solution is designed.\n\n### Third-Party Bridges\n\nBecause no one likes to wait, a number of third-party bridging services exist to help us move our funds instantly to and from L2s. Among the most popular options are [Hop Protocol](https://app.hop.exchange/) and [Across Protocol](https://across.to/bridge), but you can use [Bungee](https://bungee.exchange/) to compare bridging fees across a number of protocols. To use Across, for example, all you need to do is:\n\n1\. Go to the [Across Protocol](https://across.to/bridge) bridge and connect your wallet.\n\n2\. To bridge funds to L2, select Ethereum under ‘From’.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FSwt3yjUPwEteAiB5aU9zy.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n3\. Choose your asset and the amount you wish to bridge (Pro Tip: only bridge a blockchain’s native `coin`, in this case ETH).\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FIBRvNt1d-CEe3XkuuwTvr.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n4\. Next, select your L2 solution in ‘To’.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FMnz8fWPFIGGQp25RA6FKt.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n5\. Review the transaction, and if all looks correct, select ‘Send’.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Ff9PbrvFv90jLNB-j60XlV.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\nMoving funds from Mainnet to L2 is really that simple, and nearly all bridges work the same way. Select a blockchain to send funds from and your destination, pick an asset and amount, and across the blockchain crevice you go. Pro Tip: As with sending from a CEX, you can use [Blockscan](https://blockscan.com/bridges) to find a compatible bridge for your L2 destination.\n\n## The Road to L2\n\nLayer 2s offer users of all experience levels the opportunity to experiment with decentralized finance in a way that is often prohibitive on Mainnet. Because it costs mere pennies to transact on these networks (you can compare costs [here](https://l2fees.info/)), it’s a great place to become familiar with the basic building blocks of decentralized finance, such as swaps, `liquidity pools`, or yield farms.\n\nUsing a CEX or a bridge to move funds to L2 is a necessary step in your journey from crypto novice to crypto competency. Remember, to see your funds displayed in your wallet, you may need to add the network in your wallet settings, which can be done at [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/). If you just want to check that the funds made it safely to your L2 wallet, you can also check Etherscan (click on the ‘b’ for ‘Blockscan’ to the right of your wallet address to see L2 transactions) or go to a DEX, like [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/), and select the L2 network and the asset to see your balance.\n\nAs you scale up your skills, you’ll need to figure out how to scale down your transaction fees. Learning how to fund an L2 wallet is the first step, but the next steps on your crypto journey are up to you. Welcome, explorer, a new world awaits.\n\n\n***\n\n**Author**\n\n**[Hiro Kennelly](https://twitter.com/HiroKennelly)** is a writer, editor, and coordinator at BanklessDAO and the Editor-in-Chief at Good Morning News.

        content: '<div class="bloc1"><p>Let’s refresh how gas is calculated before we go on to see how the optimizations DEX aggregators make can reduce network fees for users.</p><p>Just like gas for a car, <code>gas</code> is the fuel for running blockchain code on Ethereum. The farther you travel, the more gas your car uses. Likewise, the more computations you do, the more gas your code requires. Gas price is measured in very small amounts of Ether called <code>gwei</code>, like cents to a dollar. 1 gwei is 1 billionth of an ether (1 gwei = 0.00000001 ETH). </p><p>Total gas cost is based on how much gas your transaction uses and the unit price of gas at the time of use. The formula for calculating the price of a transaction is as follows:<br><em>Amount of gas used * Gas price = Total gas cost</em></p><p>As an example, let’s say gas costs are at 22 gwei per gas unit and the transaction uses 120-thousand units:<br><em>120,000 * 22 gwei = 2,640,000 gwei </em><em><strong>or</strong></em><em> 0.00264 ETH</em></p></div><div class="bloc2"><img src=\'/lesson/dex-aggregators/how-gas-cost-is-calculated-on-ethereum-c34efe86.svg\'></div>'

        content: '<div class="bloc1"><p>Trade splitting would result in more transaction fees from the extra on-chain activity, except that advanced aggregators plan for transaction fees and include them in their calculations of the trade route. They simulate trades off chain, including <code>gas</code> costs, to find <code>trade routes</code> that leave Explorers with the most value at the end of the interaction.</p><p>Some aggregators go even further: they may refund some of the network transaction fees from using their protocol. 1inch currently offers rebates in their token for a portion of gas costs from trading through their <code>dApp</code> on Ethereum mainnet.</p></div><div class="bloc2"><img src=\'/lesson/dex-aggregators/how-aggregators-reduce-gas-costs-for-users-28d6f207.svg\'></div>'
